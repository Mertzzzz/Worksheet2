#Worksheet for R Programming
Instructions:
• Use RStudio or the RStudio Cloud accomplish this worksheet. + Save the R script as 
RWorksheet_lastname#2.R.
• Create your own GitHub repository and push the R script as well as this pdf worksheet to 
your own repo.
Accomplish this worksheet by answering the questions being asked and writing the code 
manually.

## Using Vectors
1. Create a vector using : operator
a. Sequence from -5 to 5. Write the R code and its output. Describe its output.
```{r}
seq.int(-5,5)
```
The output is a sequence from -5 to 5

b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
```{r}
x <- 1:7
x
```

2.* Create a vector using seq() function
a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) # specify step size
Write the R code and its output. Describe the output.
```{r}
seq(1, 3, by = 0.2)
```

The output is a sequence from 1 to 3 that increases by 0.2.

3. A factory has a census of its workers. There are 50 workers in total. The following list shows
their ages: 34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 43, 53, 41, 51, 35, 24,33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26, 18.
a. Access 3rd element, what is the value?
```{r}
Workers <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 
             49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 43, 53, 41, 51, 35, 24,33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 
             41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26, 18)
Workers[3]
```

b. Access 2nd and 4th element, what are the values?
```{r}
Workers[2]
Workers[4]
```

c. Access all but the 1st element is not included. Write the R code and its output.
```{r}
Workers[2:49]
```

4. *Create a vector x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9). Then named the vector, names(x).
a. Print the results. Then access x[c("first", "third")]. Describe the output.
```{r}
x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9)
names(x)
```

b. Write the code and its output.
```{r}
x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9)
x[c("first", "third")]
```
    
5. Create a sequence x from -3:2.
a. Modify 2nd element and change it to 0;x[2] <- 0 x
Describe the output.
-2 was replaced by 0.

 b. Write the code and its output.
```{r}
x <- -3:2
x[2] <- 0
x
```

6. *The following data shows the diesel fuel purchased by Mr. Cruz.
Month Jan Feb March Apr May June
Price per liter (PhP) 52.50 57.25 60.00 65.00 74.25 54.00
Purchase–quantity(Liters) 25 30 40 50 10 45
a. Create a data frame for month, price per liter (php) and purchase-quantity (liter).Write the codes
```{r}
Month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "March", "Apr", "May", "June")
Price_per_liter_php <- c(52.50, 57.25, 60.00, 65.00, 74.25, 54.00)
Purchase_quantity_liter <- c(25, 30, 40, 50, 10, 45) 
data_frame <- data.frame(Month, Price_per_liter_php, Purchase_quantity_liter )
```

b. What is the average fuel expenditure of Mr. Cruz from Jan to June? Note: Use
weighted.mean(liter, purchase)
```{r}
data_frame
weighted.mean(Price_per_liter_php, Purchase_quantity_liter)
```

7. R has actually lots of built-in datasets. For example, the rivers data “gives the lengths (in miles) of 141 “major” rivers in North America, as compiled by the US Geological Survey”.
a. Type “rivers” in your R console. Create a vector data with 7elements, containing the number of elements (length) in rivers, their sum (sum), mean (mean), median (median), variance (var) standard deviation (sd), minimum (min) and maximum (max).
```{r}
data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), var(rivers), 
          sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))
```

a. What are the results?
```{r}
data
```

b. Write the code and its outputs.
```{r}
data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), var(rivers), 
sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))
data
```

8. The table below gives the 25 most powerful celebrities and their annual pay as ranked by the editions of Forbes magazine and as listed on the Forbes.com website.
                    Figure 1: Forbes Ranking
                    
a. Create vectors according to the above table. Write the codes.
```{r}
PowerRanking <- 1:25
CelebrityName <- c("Tom Cruise", "Rolling Stones", "Oprah Winfrey", "U2", "Tiger Woods", 
                   "Steven Spielberg", "Howard Stern", "50 Cent", "Cast of the sopranos", 
                   "Dan Brown", "Bruce Springsteen", "Donald Trump", "Muhammad Ali", 
                   "Paul McCartney", "George Lucas", "Elton John", "David Letterman", 
                   "Phil Mickelson", "J.K Rowling", "Bradd Pitt", "Peter Jackson", 
                   "Dr. Phil McGraw", "Jay Lenon", "Celine Dion", "Kobe Bryant")
Pay <- c(67, 90, 225, 110, 90, 332, 302, 41, 52, 88, 55, 44, 55, 40, 233, 34, 40, 47, 75, 
         25, 39, 45, 32, 40, 31)
Data_Ranking <- data.frame(PowerRanking, CelebrityName, Pay)
```

b. Modify the power ranking and pay of J.K. Rowling. Change power ranking to 15 and pay to 90. Write the codes and its output.
```{r}
Data_Ranking
```
```{r}
PowerRanking [19] <- 15
Pay [19] <- 90
Data_Ranking <- data.frame(PowerRanking, CelebrityName, Pay)
Data_Ranking
```
